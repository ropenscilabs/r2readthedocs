# r2readthedocs

Convert R package documentation to a ['readthedocs'](https://readthedocs.org/) website.

## Why?

Two compelling reasons:

1. ['readthedocs'](https://readthedocs.org/) is based on a markup language
   called ['reStructuredText'
   (`.rst`)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/#benefits) which is more
   flexible and powerful than the `markdown` generally used in R packages. 
2. The structure of an R package documentation website generated with existing
   tools such as [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) is generally fixed and
   difficult to modify. The entire structure of
   a ['readthedocs'](https://readthedocs.org/) site can be very easily modified
   through changes to the underlying `.rst` files, including easy addition of
   documentation beyond the internal package-specific documentation, such as
   descriptions of use cases, of relevant data or analyses external to the
   package, or anything at all.
