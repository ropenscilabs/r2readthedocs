# r2readthedocs

Convert R package documentation to a ['readthedocs'](https://readthedocs.org/) website.

## Why?

Two compelling reasons:

1. ['readthedocs'](https://readthedocs.org/) is based on a markup language
   called ['reStructuredText'
   (`.rst`)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/#benefits) which is more
   flexible and powerful than the `markdown` generally used in R packages. 
2. The structure of an R package documentation website generated with existing
   tools such as [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) is generally fixed and
   difficult to modify. The entire structure of
   a ['readthedocs'](https://readthedocs.org/) site can be very easily modified
   through changes to the underlying `.rst` files, including easy addition of
   documentation beyond the internal package-specific documentation, such as
   descriptions of use cases, of relevant data or analyses external to the
   package, or anything at all.

## How?

For those unfamiliar with ['readthedocs'](https://readthedocs.org/) (RTD), we
recommend using the `rtd_dummy_pkg()` function provided with this package,
which generates a "skeleton" of a package which can be used to generate an RTD
site. Simply run the following two lines:

```{r rtd-dummy, eval = FALSE}
path <- rtd_dummy_pkg ()
r2readthedocs (path)
```

The RTD website will be automatically opened in your default browser. Most of
the content is automatically generated straight from the package documentation,
as for a [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) website. The primary
difference you'll immediate notice is that the front page is not the package's
`README.md` document. This is because, which `markdown` pages can be readily
inserted into `.rst` pages, this is not possible for the main page, which must
be encoded entirely in `.rst` form. The front page of any site generated with
the `r2readthedocs()` function will retain this general form, which can then be
readily adapted as desired.
